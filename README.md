# Frontend Development Course: DOM and React

## Overview

I taught fullstack development to 6 students selected from 50 applicants. The course started with the basics of the DOM (Document Object Model) and advanced to building dynamic applications using React. Students began by learning the fundamental concepts of the DOM and event handling, then progressed to creating a fully functional Todo app. The course concluded with multiple small React projects, demonstrating the power of modern JavaScript frameworks. These projects were part of the DOM and React segment of the fullstack JavaScript course.

## Course Structure

### 1. Introduction to the DOM

-   **Objective**: Understand the basics of the DOM and how to manipulate it using JavaScript.
-   **Content**:
    -   What is the DOM?
    -   Navigating the DOM tree
    -   Selecting elements
    -   Modifying elements
    -   Handling events (e.g., click events)

### 2. Building a Todo App using DOM

    -   Setting up the HTML structure
    -   Adding and removing tasks
    -   Marking tasks as completed
    -   Storing tasks in local storage

### 3. Connecting the Todo App to a Backend API

-   **Objective**: Integrate the Todo app with a backend API to persist data.
-   **Content**:
    -   Setting up the backend API (using Node.js/Express)
    -   Making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    -   Updating the UI based on API responses
    -   Error handling

### 4. Introduction to React

-   **Objective**: Learn the fundamentals of React and how to build interactive user interfaces.
-   **Content**:
    -   Setting up a React project
    -   Understanding JSX
    -   Components and props
    -   State and lifecycle methods
    -   Handling events in React

### 5. Building React Applications

-   **Objective**: Apply React concepts to build small, functional applications.
-   **Content**:

    -   **Image Gallery App**:

        -   Fetching and displaying images from an API
        -   Implementing search functionality
        -   Pagination and lazy loading

    -   **Todo App with React**:

        -   Recreating the DOM-based Todo app using React
        -   Managing state with hooks
        -   Connecting to the backend API for data persistence

    -   **Additional Projects**:
        -   Weather App: Fetching and displaying weather data from an API
        -   Recipe App: Searching and displaying recipes using a third-party API

## Conclusion

I equipped the students with the essential skills to build dynamic and interactive frontend applications. By the end of the course, students had hands-on experience in manipulating the DOM and developing robust applications using React, with a solid understanding of how to connect frontend applications to backend APIs.

The biggest UI project we built is available at [Projectify App UI](https://github.com/aliramazon/projectify-app-ui), and the backend is available at [Projectify App API](https://github.com/aliramazon/projectify-app-api).
